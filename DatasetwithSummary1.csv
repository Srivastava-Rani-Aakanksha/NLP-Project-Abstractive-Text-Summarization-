Additionally, the text suggests adding a dislike button to Twitter, as many users often express their dissatisfaction with posts they don't like. Finally, the text emphasizes that the war is going in damages, and that nato will be remembered as having lost every war. Elon Musk and Adani have both acquired leftist dominated media groups, such as Tesla and Adani Group, which have been made to tank by Musk's acquisition of a leftist dominated social media platform and Adani Group's acquisition of a leftist dominated media group. Musk also discussed the importance of a permanent moon base or a space station for medicine and scientific research, as well as the use of climate buzz words to pretend they care about the climate.

He also discussed the possibility of a major Russo-American war, as well as the destruction of Nazis. The most important details in this text are that the speaker disagrees with the idea that Russia should leave Ukraine, that Elon Musk plans to buy Disney, that age limits should be abolished, that the speaker is tired of replying to posts, that the speaker has no knowledge of the history of Ukraine, that the speaker does not have a problem with age limits, that the speaker is not direct with his answers, that the speaker has left out denazification of Ukraine and the trial of Ukrainians for war crimes, that the speaker has paid him for a check mark, that the speaker has no space, that the speaker has a race thing, and that the speaker wants black and white people to not like each other. The most important details in this text are that Nigeria wants to sell their electoral commission for free, that Twitter censors the truth, that Putin won't stop any negotiations, that China is holding hostages, that Ohio River has a deal at 145k, and that Earthchan isn't flat. These details show that it is difficult to balance the risk of trying things and failing, and that relying on defense is a losing strategy."

The text also mentions that they are trying to start a petition to throw out Dube from CSK in the middle of the season, and that they have a 500 mb net bachane k liye whatsapp status and insta stories. Mahendra Singh Dhoni is the greatest cricketer of all time, and his 200th innings against CSK chennai Super Kings was pure class and vintage. Sanju Samson as a captain is also underrated, and Mahi and Jaddu's last 3 deliveries with just 7 runs required were like as if 1 needed of 3 deliveries. Dhoni's late surge in vain as rajasthan beat chennai by 3 runs, and he should resign as skipper of the squad before he announces retirment.

The most important details in this text are that MS Dhoni won by 3 runs, and that he displayed great character and decorum on the field as captain. He also displayed great character and decorum on the field as a captain, and that he was fit as hell and still smacking sixes. He also displayed great character and decorum on the field as a wicket keeper, and that he won a lot of hearts. Finally, he expressed his desire to come out of retirement to help Indian cricket and the world cup. Ms Dhoni is an exceptional player who has been praised for his outstanding performance in the Indian Premier League (IPL).

He was the last man standing out in the last over, even if it was mathematically impossible to achieve the target in the last over. Ashwin did it at Chepauk, and Jadeja ash anna cahal, Adam Zampa, Moeen Ali, and Theekshana got their first game at Chepauk. Dhoni was on the strike and delivered some extraordinary bowling under pressure."

 'the massacre of innocent indians at jallianwala bagh reminded us of colonial rule ]","The 104th anniversary of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919 is a reminder of the sacrifices made by the forefathers to achieve independence and the need to remain vigilant against any attempt to curtail freedoms. The massacre was a stark reminder of the sacrifices made by the forefathers to achieve independence and the need to honor their memory by working towards peace, justice and unity for all. The martyrs of the massacre will live on forever as a motivation for the coming generations. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919 is a reminder of the sacrifices made by Indian forefathers to achieve independence and the need to remain vigilant against any attempt to curtail freedoms. Rabindranath Tagore renounced his titles as a sign of protest against the colonial government, and the massacre was one of the bloodiest attacks of British rule in which around 1500 people were killed.

California plans to spend 35 million in the state to support a nature campaign, which is one of the ruthless attacks of the twentieth century. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919 was a brutal and gruesome mass murder of unarmed people gathered for peaceful protest. It was a strategy of terror and repression to intimidate the Indian public. Today, we pay homage to the martyrs of the massacre and vow to never forget their sacrifice for India's independence. We remember their bravery and vow to never forget their sacrifice for India's independence.

The US lawmaker urges Antony Blinken to support human rights democracy in Pakistan. He remembers the martyrs of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, which was one of the darkest chapters in India's freedom struggle. He asks if khalistani pigs are protesting in front of Buckingham Palace over the massacre."
